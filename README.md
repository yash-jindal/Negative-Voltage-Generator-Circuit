# Negative-Voltage-Generator-Circuit
This Project will enable us to generate a stable negative voltage using single rail supply.

This is to be achieved by using a 555-timer as an oscillator and a simple arrangement of diodes with capacitor.
555 Oscillator is used as an astable multivibrator  and generates a positive square wave.
Using capacitors and diodes this is converted into a constant negative voltage.
